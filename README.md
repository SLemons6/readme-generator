# Readme Generator 

## Purpose: 
A command-line application that utilizes node.js to quickly generate a professional-quality readme based on user input. 

## How to Use: 
1. Copy the application files to a directory of your choice.  
2. Open the root directory of the app in your command prompt and use 'npm install' to install the required packages. 
3. With the directory still opened in your command prompt, type 'node index.js' to start the application. 
4. Answer the necessary prompts for your readme.  Hit the enter button to submit an answer to whatever prompt you're on and proceed to the next prompt.  On the prompts where it includes multiple choices, use the arrow keys to cycle through the choices and the space bar to select or deselect your desired choices. Pressing the enter button twice may be required to cycle to the next prompt if it doesn't respond to the first button press.
5. After the application has finished the prompts, it will create a readme markdown file and send it to the 'dist' folder inside the 'Develop' folder for you to use.
